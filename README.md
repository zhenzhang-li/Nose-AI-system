# Nose-AI-system
## An executable file to predict the nose image
Unzip the 7z file, open the command line in the predict folder, and enter the following command
```cmd
predict -l Picture Path
```
After the command is executed, the prediction result and cam map of the image will be obtained in the path of the image.

Summary:
Nasal diseases such as rhinosinusitis and allergic rhinitis, for which diagnoses are frequently misdiagnosed or delayed, especially nasopharyngeal carcinoma. This is one of the most common problems faced by primary care clinicians. However, a revolutionary intelligent assisted diagnosis strategy, in which artificial intelligence technology may play a significant role, is required due to the shortage of experienced professional doctors and the generally poor diagnostic accuracy. Here, by improving the newly emerging image recognition framework, Swin Transformer, it may avoid the drawbacks of the inductive bias problem for the depth convolution neural network model. Moreover, add a stage module to prevent the feature map from being reduced too quickly. To reach the goal of obtaining a model with a high prediction accuracy, the upgraded model is trained by gathering a significant amount of nasal endoscopic images from patients who have received clinical confirmation. The successful identification of 7 prevalent nasal diseases (97.57%), and the recognition rate of nasopharyngeal cancer reached 100%. To facilitate clinical operation, a real-time detection system is developed with the clinically test accuracyÂ of 98.14%. The accuracy is higher than that of specialist doctors with 9 years of work experience in the experiment of man-machine comparison. Additionally, the current research is unparalleled in terms of disease diversity and diagnostic accuracy. This research showed that the intelligent recognition system formed by the improved Swin Transformer model is useful for the clinical detection of nasal diseases.
